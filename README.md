# ELIXIR jobs widget

This is a simple snippet of Javascript you can paste in a web page. It displays the jobs listed on the [ELIXIR Europe jobs page](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/vacancies).

It was meant for non-technical users and/or those with no time.

## Usage

Copy and paste the following text into your web page, where you want the job list to appear. If you are using a content management system like Wordpress you will need to use the 'Text' (or 'Source' or 'Code') editor to do this.


        <!-- START OF ELIXIR JOBS WIDGET -->
        <!--
        HTML template for the jobs listing. The default here is a table.
        You can change this to what you want (e.g. a list) but you need to keep
        'template-wrapper' as the id of the parent element and 'template-item'
        as the id of the element that wraps each job.  The placeholders {{title}},
        {{location}} and {{closingDate}} are populated by the script.
        -->
        <table>
            <thead>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Location</th>
            <th>Closing date</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody id="template-wrapper">
            <script id="template-item" type="text/template">
            <tr>
                <td>{{title}}</td>
                <td>{{location}}</td>
                <td>{{closingDate}}</td>
            </tr>
            </script>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/vacancies/form" target="_blank">Submit a job</a> on the ELIXIR Europe website.</p>
        <script src="https://elixir-europe.org/sites/all/libraries/jobs/elixir-jobs.js"></script>

### Notes on usage

 - The table will inherit the style of your website. It has no styling with it.
 - There is no title to the table. You need to put that above the pasted code.
 - The table shows all jobs from the ELIXIR job vacancies page, including jobs from industry.
 - You can change the HTML in the code above as long as you keep the placeholders `{{title}}`, `{{location}}` and `{{closingDate}}`, and you keep the ids `template-wrapper` and `template-item`.
 - If the script can't connect to the file where the jobs are located (on the ELIXIR server) then it will say, "There are no jobs to show at the moment". If you get this message contact [webmaster@elixir-europe.org](mailto:webmaster@elixir-europe.org).

## More technical notes

This is a quick fix solution for people who want to embed the ELIXIR jobs on their site. It is a simple script that calls some JSON from the ELIXIR server, parses it, and puts it in an HTML template. 

Of course it would be better to run the JSON request as a cron job, or other periodic request, and cache the results locally. Similarly the Javascript could be stored locally. This would speed the page up and protect against connection problems. However it wouldn't then be a non-technical, zero configuration solution, which was the goal.

The script is vanilla Javascript and the only dependency is [https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser](https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser). For development, [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) was used.
